# Analytics (moved to Dataform repo)

Analytics pipelines and Dataform models now live in https://github.com/OliverSilveti/etrendo-dataform.

How to work with analytics:
- Clone that repo and run Dataform from there (CLI or Dataform web).
- Manage transformations, schedules, and CI/CD in that repo.
- This repo keeps ingestion/agent code; the analytics folder is only a pointer.
